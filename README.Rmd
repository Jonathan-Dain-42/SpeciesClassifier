The goal of SpeciesClassifier is to make the process of dealing with avian species data less of a headache. This package contains several functions that aim to replace common species names with latin species names. In addition the functions will also add order and family taxonomic labels.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SpeciesClassifyR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jonathan-Dain-42/SpeciesClassifyR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example in which we take common names and add in a latin name column, a family column, and an order column. 

```{r example}
library(SpeciesClassifyR)

## basic example code
load("data/test_dat.rda")

head(test_dat) #Notice the common names are in the "Species" column

classify_species.common(data = test_dat,species_col = "Species") |> head()

```
## Additional Information:

A full tutorial on the other functions that this package contains can be found on my academic blog [here]()
